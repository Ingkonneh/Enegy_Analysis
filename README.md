# Energy Consumption Time Series Analysis

This project conducts a comprehensive examination and analysis of hourly energy consumption data, utilizing advanced time series analysis techniques to provide predictive insights into future energy consumption trends.

## Overview

The main objective of this project is to predict future energy consumption based on historical hourly energy usage data. The project is structured into key stages, each contributing to achieving the overall goal.

## Detailed Description

1. **Data Loading and Preparation:** Initial steps involve loading the energy consumption dataset and preprocessing, including setting up the correct datetime index for the time series data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Thorough analysis uncovers patterns, anomalies, or insights. Data visualization techniques are employed to better understand the distribution and trends in the data.

3. **Feature Engineering:** New features are derived from existing data to enhance the predictive power of machine learning models. These include time-based features such as hour of the day, day of the week, and quarter of the year.

4. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:** Three predictive models—XGBoost, ARIMA, and LSTM—are trained on the dataset. A grid search approach optimizes the XGBoost model's hyperparameters.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Model performance is evaluated using error metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for comparative study.

6. **Prediction and Visualization:** Predictive performance is visualized through plots comparing actual versus predicted energy consumption. Feature importance for the best-performing model is evaluated and visualized.

7. **Forecasting:** Future energy consumption values are forecasted using the best-performing model, essential for future energy planning and management.
